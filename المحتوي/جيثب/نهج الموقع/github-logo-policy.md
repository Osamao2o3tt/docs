You can add {0% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom 0%} logos to your website or third-party application in some scenarios. For more information and specific guidelines on logo usage, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Logos and Usage page](https://github.com/logos).

You can also use an octocat as your personal avatar or on your website to link to your {0% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom 0%} account, but not for your company or a product you're building. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has an extensive collection of octocats in the [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/). For more information on using the octocats from the Octodex, see the [Octodex FAQ](https://octodex.github.com/faq/).
